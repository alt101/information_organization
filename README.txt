“Combining the Apparatus Responses and Personnel Responses Data Sets”


Questions:
What was the breakdown of the ranks of personnel that responded to each incident?  
A table would be best suited to visualize the data for this question.  This table would include the incident identification number and each separate rank, followed by the number of people that possess that rank.

Did the calls that required assistance from other counties have more responding personnel, compared to calls that did not require assistance?  
A bar graph would be best suited to visualize the data for this question.  This would compare the average number of responding personnel for regular calls and the average number of responding personnel for calls that required assistance from other counties.

Did “careers” or “volunteers” have a faster “enroute scene time” from dispatch time?  
A bar graph would be best suited to visualize the data for this question.  This would compare the average responding time for career status members and the average responding tome fore volunteer members.
